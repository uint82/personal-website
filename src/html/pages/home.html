      <h4>I'm Hilmi Abroor</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a <strong>web developer</strong>, <strong>speedcuber</strong>, and
        all-around cool dude, born in <strong>Surabaya, Indonesia</strong>.

        This site is my sandbox. No heavy frameworks, no bloat—just me seeing
        how far I can push <strong>Vanilla TypeScript</strong> and
        <strong>CSS</strong>
        before I lose my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started building this on <strong>December 12, 2025</strong>. It's
        built using <strong>Vite, vanilla TypeScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>.
        Everything here is written in <strong>Neovim on Arch Linux</strong>
        (I use Arch, btw) and tested in Firefox.

        Think of this space as part portfolio, part laboratory. Some pages are
        polished, others are broken experiments I decided to keep. It’s a living
        project, so if something looks weird, I'm probably editing the CSS right
        now.

        Poke around the code, check the <strong>changelog</strong>, or reach out
        if you want to chat.
