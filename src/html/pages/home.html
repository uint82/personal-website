      <h4>I'm Hilmi Abroor</h4>
      <p>
        I'm a <strong>web developer</strong>, <strong>speedcuber</strong>, and
        all-around cool dude, born in <strong>Surabaya, Indonesia</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my time goes into building and experimenting through
        <strong>personal projects</strong>. Each project on this site represents
        something I wanted to understand better - whether that’s tooling, UI
        behavior, or performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this website on <strong>December 12, 2025</strong>. It's built
        using <strong>Vite, vanilla TypeScript, HTML, and CSS</strong>. All code
        is written using <strong>Neovim on Arch Linux</strong> and tested in
        <strong>Firefox</strong> at 1920×1080 resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site serves as my personal space on the web - part portfolio, part
        playground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some pages exist purely for fun, experimentation, or personal interest.
        This website is a living project, so things may change, break, or
        suddenly look different.
      </p>

        Feel free to explore, read around, and stick for a while. If you want to

      <p>
        This site is under perpetual construction! I'm constantly tweaking
        things; see my
        <strong>changelog and to-do list</strong> for more.
