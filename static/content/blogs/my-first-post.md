# Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my journey in web development.

It's strange to finally have a space that's truly mine. No Medium paywalls, no platform algorithms deciding who sees what I write—just a simple site I built from scratch. This is where I'll document what I'm learning, what I'm building, and probably some mistakes along the way.

Why start now? Because I've been putting it off for too long. Every developer says "I should start a blog," and then... they don't. So here we are. No more excuses.

## What I've Learned

Over the past few months, I've been diving deep into modern web development. Here are some key takeaways:

**TypeScript is a game-changer for large applications.** I resisted it at first—"why add complexity when JavaScript works fine?" But once I started working on bigger projects, the type safety saved me countless hours of debugging. Autocomplete that actually knows what properties exist? Yes, please.

**Component-based architecture makes code more maintainable.** Breaking UI into reusable pieces isn't just a React thing—it's a mindset. Even in vanilla JavaScript, thinking in components keeps your code organized. Each piece does one thing well, and that's powerful.

**SPA routing is fun to implement from scratch.** Everyone uses libraries, but building your own router teaches you how the web actually works. The History API, event delegation, lifecycle management—it's all there if you look. Framework magic becomes a lot less magical when you've implemented it yourself.

## Getting Started

If you're just starting out, here's my advice:

**Build things you actually want to use.** Forget todo lists and generic portfolios. What tool would make your life easier? What site do you wish existed? Build that. You'll stay motivated, and you'll ship something real.

**Read the documentation.** I know, boring. But MDN is actually good. So is the TypeScript handbook. Skip the Medium articles that regurgitate the same "10 tips" and go straight to the source. It's faster, and you'll learn more.

**Don't wait for perfection.** This site isn't perfect. There are probably bugs I haven't found yet. The CSS could be cleaner. But it's live, and that's what matters. You can always improve it later—you can't improve something that doesn't exist.

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for more posts about my web development journey!

I'm planning to write about the routing system I built, some UI experiments with dynamic typography, and maybe a deep dive into how I'm handling markdown parsing for this blog. No schedule, no promises—just writing when I have something worth sharing.

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Feel free to check out the code on my GitHub. And if you find a bug, well... that's what issues are for.

Here's to building in public and learning out loud.
