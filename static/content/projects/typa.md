A minimal, terminal-based typing speed test written in Rust.

Typa is designed to be a lightweight, keyboard-centric alternative to web-based typing tests. It runs entirely in your terminal with support for custom themes and multiple testing modes.

## Features

- **Multiple Test Modes**:
  - **Time**: Test against a countdown timer (15, 30, 60, 120 seconds).
  - **Words**: Type a set number of words (10, 25, 50, etc.).
  - **Quote**: Type specific quotes from a curated database.

- **Detailed Statistics**: View WPM, raw WPM, accuracy, and character breakdowns (correct/incorrect/extra/missed) after every test run.

- **Customization**:
  - Built-in color themes selectable by name.
  - Full custom color theme support via TOML configuration file.
  - Toggle punctuation and numbers independently.
  - Multiple language support (English and Indonesian).

- **Responsive UI**:
  - Clean, distraction-free interface.
  - Line wrapping that adapts to terminal width.

## Installation

### Install with Cargo

```bash
cargo install typa
```

### Examples

```bash
# Run a 60 second test
typa -t 60

# Run a 50 word test
typa -w 50

# Run a short quote test
typa -q short

# Run a 30 second test with punctuation and numbers
typa -t 30 -p -n

# Run a 100 word test in Indonesian with punctuation
typa -w 100 -l indonesian_1k -p

# Run a quote test in Indonesian
typa -q short -l indonesian

# Run a specific quote by ID
typa -q 42

# Run a very long quote test
typa -q verylong
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

During a test:

- **Tab**: Restart the current test
- **Esc** or **Ctrl+Q**: Quit the application

## Configuration

Typa supports color themes via a TOML configuration file, either by selecting a built-in theme by name or defining your own custom colors.

### Configuration File Location

The configuration file should be named `config.toml` and placed in:

- **Linux**: `~/.config/typa/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/typa/config/config.toml`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\typa\config\config.toml`

**Note**: If the configuration directory doesn't exist, you'll need to create it manually before adding your `config.toml` file.

### Built-in Themes

Select a built-in theme by name:

```toml
theme = "gruvbox"
```

Available built-in themes:

| Name            | Description                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `default`       | Gruvbox dark                 |
| `gruvbox_dark`  | Gruvbox dark                 |
| `gruvbox_light` | Gruvbox light                |

### Custom Theme

To define your own colors, add a `[custom_theme]` section. This takes priority over the `theme` setting above.

```toml
[custom_theme]
bg = "#2c2e34"          # Background color
main = "#e2b714"        # Brand color (timer, active stats, highlights)
caret = "#e2b714"       # Cursor block color
text = "#d1d0c5"        # Correctly typed text
sub = "#646669"         # Untyped text, UI labels, footer instructions
subAlt = "#45474d"      # UI borders, subtle elements
error = "#ca4754"       # Incorrect / extra characters
```

All colors should be specified in hexadecimal format. If no configuration is found, the `default` theme is used.

## Statistics Explanation

After completing a test, you'll see several metrics:

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Your typing speed adjusted for accuracy. Calculated as `(correct_chars / 5 - uncorrected_errors) / time_in_minutes`.
- **Raw WPM**: Your typing speed without accuracy adjustments. Calculated as `(all_typed_chars / 5) / time_in_minutes`.
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of characters typed correctly: `(correct_chars / total_chars) × 100`.
- **Character Breakdown**:
  - **cor**: Correctly typed characters
  - **inc**: Incorrectly typed characters
  - **ext**: Extra characters typed beyond the expected text
  - **mis**: Characters you skipped or didn't type
- **Time**: Total time spent on the test in seconds

## Quote Mode Details

Quote mode allows you to type passages from a curated collection. Quotes are categorized by length:

- **Short**: 0 - 100 words
- **Medium**: 101 - 300 words
- **Long**: 301 - 600 words
- **Very Long**: 601 - 9999 words
- **All**: Random selection from all categories

You can also select a specific quote by its ID number if you know it.

## Language Support

Typa includes word lists and quote collections for multiple languages. The default is English, but you can specify others using the `-l` flag.

Word lists and quote collections are independent. A word list (used in time and word modes) and a quote collection (used in quote mode) do not need to match — only the relevant file is loaded depending on the mode:

- **Time / Words mode** loads `language/{name}.json`
- **Quote mode** loads `quotes/{name}.json`

This means you can use a specific word list like `indonesian_1k` in word mode without needing a matching quote file to exist.

Currently supported languages:

| Language   | Word list        | Quotes       |
|------------|------------------|--------------|
| English    | `english`        | `english`    |
| Indonesian | `indonesian_1k`  | `indonesian` |
